# **Palindrome Checker with Conditionals and Loops**
### **IFSL1T07 - Beginner Control Structures â€” Loops**

## **Description**
This program uses a while loop and 'if..else' statement that prompts the user to enter a word. It then reverses the word, checks if the word reversed is the same as the original word and outputs the result to the console and as an alert.

## **Installation and Setup**
1. Clone the repo and open with your preferred IDE (e.g. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)).
2. In the IDE, open the palindrome.html file and click the 'run' button, or click 'Go Live' if using VSCode. This should open your browser automatically to your localhost port with '/palindrome.html' as the URL endpoint.

<hr>

## **How to Use**
1. Once the html file is loaded in your browser, a popup window will appear asking you to enter a word.
2. Once entered, another popup will return whether or not the inputted word is a palindrome.
